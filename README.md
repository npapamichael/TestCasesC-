Objective: The goal is to create a "Smart Building Controller" software for managing various systems within a building, such as doors, lights, and fire alarms.

Methodology: The development process follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, where tests are written before the actual code. This ensures that the software meets requirements and maintains quality through automated testing.

Components:

BuildingController Class: The main class responsible for managing building systems and interacting with dependencies.
Interfaces: Interfaces define contracts for interacting with external dependencies like light managers, door managers, etc.
Unit Tests: Test cases are written to validate the functionality of the BuildingController class and ensure it behaves as expected.
Project Report: A documentation detailing the TDD process followed, including annotated screenshots and explanations.
Implementation Process:

Requirement Levels: Requirements are categorized into levels (e.g., Level 1, Level 2, etc.), indicating their complexity.
Test-Driven Approach: Developers start by writing failing unit tests based on requirements, then implement the minimum code necessary to pass those tests.
Refactoring: After passing tests, code is refactored to improve design and maintainability while ensuring all tests still pass.
Submission:

Completed C# project including the BuildingController class and associated unit tests.
Project report documenting the TDD process.
Participation in in-class project demonstrations where new requirements are given, and students create corresponding test cases.
In summary, the assignment tasks students with developing a software solution using C# and TDD principles to create a Smart Building Controller, ensuring functionality, quality, and adherence to specified requirements through comprehensive testing and documentation.
